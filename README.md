# Graph Representation Learning Implementations

A repository containing my implementations of various algorithms and measures from the book "Graph Representation Learning" by William L. Hamilton.

Implementations will be pure Python and standard library, but I will turn to PyTorch when dealing with Graph Neural Networks.
